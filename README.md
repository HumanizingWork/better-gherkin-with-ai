# better-gherkin-with-ai
`gherkin.instructions.md` defines instructions for code reviews of Gherkin (*.feature) files, per the recommendations in "Behavior-Driven Development with Cucumber" by Richard Lawrence and Paul Rayner (bddwithcucumber.com).

Designed to work in, for example, a Claude project to review individual feature files or as custom code review instructions for feature files in Copilot.

It's highly opinionated. If you like the same style of Gherkin I do, it'll work great for you. If you disagree about something, feel free to download or fork it and modify it to your taste. 

For more context on these recommendations, see chapters 6 and 7 of "Behavior-Driven Development with Cucumber."
